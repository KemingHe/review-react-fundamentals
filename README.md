## How to use this proj

1. Git clone to your local machine,
2. Look through the simple file structure,

```
review-react-foundamentals/
|-review-react-fundamentals/
├── .index.html.old    (basic React practice, not part of Next app)
├── app/
│   ├── layout.js        (template comp for every page)
│   ├── page.jsx         (server page comp)
│   └── button-like.jsx  (client button comp)
├── .gitignore           (for Node)
├── LICENSE              (MIT)
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── (other stuff not important/auto-gen)
```

3. Run project on your http://localhost:3000/ (this should auto-install the necessary modules first time running):

```
npm run dev
```

4. Take a look at the comments, very help.
